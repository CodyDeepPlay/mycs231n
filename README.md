# mycs231n
This is the respository where I store my home work for Stanford CS231n class. 
The original repository was cloned from cs231n.github. you can find it here (http://cs231n.github.io/)
After I finish the homework and add my own solutions, I uploaded my work files here.

All the assignments here are based on the stanford cs231n class Spring 2018. 

Each folder include the original .ipynb note book, corresponding to each .ipython note book, there is a .py file that copies the .ipython note book into a .py file and shows the solution for each question.
For example, within folder assignment1, you will find knn.ipynb, which has the solution in Q1KNN.py. 

This repository didn't include the datasets, due to it large size. Please refer to cs231n class website for data downloading for this assignment.
